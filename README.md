# MMR-Vaccination-Data-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccination rates across various institutions in different states. The goal is to uncover insights that could inform public health strategies and vaccination campaigns.The goal is to uncover insights that could inform public health strategies and vaccination campaigns. The analysis includes visualizations of vaccination rates by state, institution type, enrollment numbers, and correlations between these factors.
## Dataset
The dataset contains vaccination rate data for 46,412 schools in 32 states across the U.S. for the school years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. It was compiled by The Wall Street Journal.

## Visualizations
- `plot_mmr_distribution`: Shows the distribution of MMR vaccination rates across regions.
- `plot_mmr_by_state`: Reveals variability in vaccination rates between states.
- `plot_enrollment_distribution`: Illustrates the distribution of enrollment numbers, highlighting how institution size may affect herd immunity.
- `plot_mmr_by_type`: Compares MMR vaccination rates by institution type.
- `plot_correlation_heatmap`: Examines the correlation between enrollment numbers and vaccination rates, among other factors.

## Setup and Installation
